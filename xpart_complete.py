"""Turn our open, surface-split parts into closed solids with X-Part (Hunyuan3D-Part).

Splitting one shell into parts leaves every part open where it was cut, and the remesh's
inner walls sit inside as separate shells. X-Part regenerates each part as a complete
watertight shape from the whole object plus a bounding box prompt, so the cuts are healed
by generation rather than by capping geometry we do not have.

The bridge is the box list. X-Part's own P3-SAM predicts boxes; here they come from our
segmentation instead, which is the point -- our part decomposition is the thing we want
completed. Two things have to happen first:

* boxes must be per instance, not per name. Our parts.glb holds one node per name, so
  "arm" is both arms and its box spans the whole body; each node is therefore split into
  welded connected components.
* the remesh puts an inner wall inside every part, as a second shell whose box the outer
  shell's box swallows; a component contained in a bigger component *of the same part* is
  therefore dropped. Containment across parts is left alone -- a hand sits inside the
  arm's box and is still its own prompt.

Two things about X-Part are worth knowing before reading the rest. It is not a function of
its prompt -- a part-identity embedding is drawn by `torch.randperm` every forward pass, so
the same part from the same prompt can come back many times its own size, and --redraws
exists to draw it again. And a box is a lossy way to describe a part, which is the next
paragraph.

A box on its own is a lossy way to describe a part, and it is where the quality goes.
X-Part conditions each part on the source surface it finds *inside the box*, so anything
else that passes through the box is handed over as part of the prompt: the robot's torso
box also contains the tops of both legs, and what comes back is a torso with legs. The box
cannot say otherwise, because a box is all it is.

We are not limited to a box. The split already decided, per face, which part each triangle
belongs to, so --condition surface samples the conditioning points from exactly those
faces and passes them as `part_surface_inbbox` -- the same tensor X-Part would have built
by cropping, only built from the assignment instead. The box still goes along; it is what
sizes the token budget. This is the tight version of the handoff, and the box-cropped one
is kept as --condition box to compare against.

Run with the X-Part venv (see --xpart_root); nothing here imports SegviGen.
