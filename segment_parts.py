"""A 3D model (+ text prompts) -> one glb with geometrically clean parts.

This replaces segment_api.segment (2D map steers the generative model) and
segment_vote.segment_vote (one full_seg sample, coverage voting). Both decided part
boundaries from evidence that can be wrong per triangle; here geometry decides every
boundary and language only chooses names:

    1. paint. A model the renders show as grey gets a temporary flat colour, because SAM3
       finds nothing on an untextured one (flat_paint.py). Textured models skip this.
    2. guidance. Multi-view SAM3 masks for the prompts, plus the overlays a human reviews.
       These come before the expensive samples on purpose: a bad prompt set is visible
       here, and the split has not been paid for yet.
    3. split. N prompt-free full_seg samples, the conditioning camera jittered around the
       front, their partitions intersected ("meet") so every cut any sample drew is kept
       -> deliberately over-segmented atoms that no later step has to cut again.
    4. units. Atoms are cut into connected components and each remesh inner wall is fused
       into the shell it lines, which must happen before anything is named.
    5. merge, gated by `--merge`: the step-2 masks vote on each unit, then same-named
       units are fused and exported.
    6. complete, gated by `--complete`: our parts are open where they were cut, so X-Part
       regenerates each as a closed solid from the whole model plus a box prompt
       (xpart_complete.py). `--complete full` then bakes the source albedo onto those
       solids. Look at "boxes" first -- a box is a lossy prompt, and a part whose box
       overlaps its neighbours' comes back filled out to that box.

Steps 3 and 6 cost GPU minutes; the rest costs seconds once the renders are cached.
`--merge off` stops after step 4 and writes one node per unit -- still producing the
guidance overlays if prompts were given -- so the two halves can be looked at, and argued
about, separately:

    python segment_parts.py --glb robot.glb --merge off --out split/units.glb
    python merge_parts.py --glb robot.glb --split split/work --prompts "head, torso, arm" \
        --out named/parts.glb

Why over-segment first: full_seg has no granularity control and a single sample fuses
neighbouring parts often enough to matter (on the robot test model, shoulder armour and
both arms came out as one 24k-face atom in every same-view sample). Over-segmentation is
free for the merge, which can only fuse atoms, while under-segmentation is unrecoverable.

Run with the SegviGen venv; SAM3 is dispatched to --py_sam3 and X-Part to --py_xpart,
each in its own environment, as in segment_api.py.

    Args:
        prompts: one entry per output part; join concepts with '+' to merge them into one
            part, optionally under a name ("body=head+face+hand"). Empty prompts become
            主体 / 底座 so SAM3 still names a body and a base.
        samples: how many full_seg samples to intersect. 1 reproduces the old single-sample
            behaviour. What more samples buy is not a finer split but a less lucky one.
            One draw of 5 left Mickey with 13 atoms, the largest covering 48% of the
            surface and the ears never cut away from the head, so no prompt could name
            them; a different draw of 5 gave 34 atoms and all six parts. That spread
            between draws is wider than the gap between 5 and 9, and it is what the extra
            samples close: 7 and 9 both land on the same six parts. 9 is not worth the two
            extra passes -- it adds atoms (40 against 34) without adding a part.
            Reading each sample more finely does not substitute -- dropping color_tol from
            20 to 3 multiplied the labels per sample twentyfold and produced the same 13
            atoms, because the extra labels are speckle. Only another sample can draw a
            cut that no sample drew.
        azimuth / azimuth_jitter: the conditioning camera, and how far the extra samples
            orbit either side of it. See sample_azimuths. Widening the jitter is not a
            substitute for more samples and can cost parts: at 60 degrees several of
            Mickey's samples came back with 2-6 labels, and those near-blank partitions
            fragment the meet along boundaries that are not real. 9 samples at 60 gave
            more atoms than at 30 and two fewer named parts.
        granularity: how fine the split may get, as a name for both size floors at once
            (see GRANULARITY). Passing `min_atom_faces` or `min_unit_faces` overrides the
            corresponding half. Over-segmenting is close to free -- the merge only ever
            fuses -- so this is less about the part count than about whether the units
            stay big enough for a camera to vote on.
        mirror: "auto" also intersects each sample reflected across the model's symmetry
            plane, if it has one -- full_seg often cuts a joint on one side only.
        merge: "off" writes one node per unit; "name", "unit" and "fragments" hand
            over to merge_parts.py (see its `merge`). Empty prompts fill 主体 / 底座
            and keep the requested merge. Guidance overlays follow the filled prompts.
        fragment_share: with merge=fragments, a unit below this share of the surface
            is a speck. Smaller keeps more pieces.
        flat_paint: "auto" gives a model the renders show as grey a temporary flat colour
            before prompting; "off" always prompts on the render as it is.
        view_azimuths / view_elevations / radius / resolution: the grid SAM3 votes over.
            No per-model front view is needed, which is the point of voting across views.
        unassigned_to: name of the part absorbing units no concept claimed
            (default body). Without it, or if the name is not in the prompts,
            those faces are dropped from the output.
        with_texture: bake the source albedo onto each part (needs bpy); off gives each
            part a flat placeholder colour instead.

    Returns a parts.json-style manifest, one row per exported part.
