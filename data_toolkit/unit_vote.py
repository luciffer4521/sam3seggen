"""Name over-segmented atoms from multi-view SAM3 masks: unit-level IoU voting.

Input is a face-labelled reference mesh (atoms from meet_samples.py) plus the raw
per-view masks sam3_multiview.py saved. Output is one part name per face. Faces are
never cut inside a unit: the vote can only merge atoms, never redraw a boundary.

Four decisions that matter, all measured on the robot test case:

* units are the welded connected components of each atom (>= `min_unit_faces`), so an
  atom SegviGen painted one colour but that is physically two pieces can take two names;
* coverage (recall) decides whether a mask claims a unit at all, but among the masks that
  do, the most specific one wins (highest IoU) -- plain coverage lets superset concepts
  win (leg over foot, arm over hand) because the larger mask always covers the smaller
  unit completely, while plain IoU starves small units of an over-segmentation, whose
  IoU with any part-sized mask is low by construction;
* that decision is made *per view*, and each view where the unit is big enough to judge
  casts one vote. Pooling pixels across views instead lets whichever view happens to see
  the unit head-on outvote all the others, which is exactly the view where a part half
  hidden behind another one gets its neighbour's name;
* the remesh's inner walls are invisible to every camera and would otherwise all fall to
  the same name; hidden units inherit the label of the nearest visible face instead;
* a visible unit no mask claimed is not automatically the dump bucket. Mickey's whiskers
  are their own atom, SAM3's head mask stops at the cheeks, and `--unassigned_to torso`
  then painted them onto the body. A sliver that only touches voted units and is a small
  fraction of them joins those units; a large unvoted region (the torso, hanging off the
  head at the neck) still goes to `unassigned_to`.
